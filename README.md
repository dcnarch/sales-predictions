# Predicting Future Item Sales for Big Mart.
- This repository is a project I created for predicting food sales for a fake company called Big Mart. Completed with Python/Pandas.

Source data can be found here: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/

> ## My goal is to create the most precise predictive Machine Learning model based on the company's prior sales trends. Our target is to predict the total number of sales of a specific item per outlet (outlet being a grocery store, supermarket, etc.), based on prior sales data and applying that to future/new items the company may introduce to sell.
