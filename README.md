# Predicting Future Sales 
This repository is a project I created for predicting food sales for a fake company called Big Mart.  
Source data can be found here: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/
Completed with Python/Pandas.
My goal is to create the most precise predictive Machine Learning model based on the company's prior sales trends.
